# about-me

I'm Yannis Peyret, interim/fractional CFO available for hire, ex-CFO at Holberton. I scale companies and innovate on new financial products. Prior to joining Holberton, I was on the founding team at [Docker](https://docker.com/) (previously dotCloud). I'm always interested in talking to interesting people -- if you are a founder and looking for help fundraising, global expansion, mergeres & acquisition, forecasting, or simply building out and automating your backoffice, don't hesitate to reach out. 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannispeyret/) if you'd like to connect.
